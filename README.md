# Computer graphics semester task specification

In the game, the player must find a futuristic Porsche among a few house objects. The player can navigate through the track in first-person view, and upon finding the car, they can "exit the game" by pressing the ESC key.
Camera control is done with the mouse, while movement is controlled using the W, A, S, D key combinations.
Pressing the 1 and 2 keys allows the player to move one house up and down. The player needs to discover the purpose of this action. Only in this one house can we look inside, as we collide with the other houses if we try to enter. Additionally, there is collision on every edge of the track, preventing us from walking into "off-limits areas."
The + and - keys can increase the brightness of the track. Along the edges of the track, we can observe the movement of water based on sinusoidal waves. The game also features a Hard Mode for the more adventurous, where fog covers the entire track. Hard Mode can be toggled on/off using the 3 key.
The player can request further assistance by pressing the F1 key.
